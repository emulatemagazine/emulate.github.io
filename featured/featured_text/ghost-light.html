        Mamma, I met God and I think I’m gonna marry him. <br>
        And Mamma, he didn’t tell me I had pretty eyes, but <br>
        Maybe he would if I painted them on the right color <br>
        And Mamma, I’ve never been beautiful before, but <br>
        Mamma, can you show me how if I sit still for you? <br>
        Mamma, I met God and he’s got stars in his smile, <br>
        And mismatched jawbones, and hair like a real halo <br>
        Mamma, I met God and his eyes are gold and green <br>
        And Mamma, my fingers don’t fit my hands anymore. <br>
        Mamma, it gets dark backstage after the curtain call. <br>
        Mamma, if you go, will you leave the ghost light on? <br>
    </div>
