        I said I learned my lesson <br> 
        but I knew that I was lying <br> 
        on my back, you told me <br> 
        that you’d hurt me every time <br>  <br> 
        and I knew that you were bluffing <br> 
        but I was scared you weren’t <br> 
        so I ran away as always <br> 
        and left you <br> 
        on the curb <br>  <br> 
        I felt the salt upon my skin <br> 
        and I knew that I was home <br> 
        and home’s the same as always <br> 
        cause I’m always here alone <br>  <br> 
        I miss the way it used to be <br> 
        back when I was young <br> 
        but I’m changing with the ocean <br> 
        and I know that soon <br>  <br> 
        I’ll be gone <br> 
        I’ll be gone <br>  <br> 
        and I worry too much <br> 
        and I worry too much <br> 
        I worry too much <br>  <br> 
        I just want to be yours <br> 
        I just want to be yours <br>  <br> 
        I tore myself open for you <br> 
        like I always do <br> 
        thought it was the right decision <br> 
        but I knew it wasn’t true <br>  <br> 
        I’m scared of being lonely <br> 
        I hate being in the dark <br> 
        I’m trying to feel normal <br> 
        but time and time again <br> 
        I’m not <br>  <br> 
        and I worry too much <br> 
        I just want to be yours
    </div>
